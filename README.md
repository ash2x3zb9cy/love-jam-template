# LÖVE Game Jam Template

This is a simple template project for the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) game engine.
It uses [closure-based classes](http://lua-users.org/wiki/ObjectOrientationTutorial) to allow entities to manage their own state and rendering.

## Usage

Make a class that extends `lib/Sprite`, or write code straight into `main`!
